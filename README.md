# Mollie Stephenson

A passionate, affable and dedicated developer, who finds real joy in not just building, but ensuring that everything I build is of the highest quality.  I've always loved creating, which, coupled with a keen desire to learn, made me perfectly suited for Makers Academy, which is where I found my passion for software development and design.  

When I graduated, there was no question that I wanted to pursue a career in development.  I'm looking for somewhere where I can continue to learn, to constantly improve and to build software with a team of people as passionate as I am about shipping great products and high quality code.


## Skills

#### Full Stack Developer

I consider myself a full stack developer because I love every aspect of the process of building software.  I am yet to find a technology or language that I do not enjoy, and never been afraid to explore the unknown. As a result, I have built projects not just with Rails and Angular, the two frameworks taught at Makers, but also with Ember, Node and Ionic.  Here are a few examples of projects I really enjoyed working on:

##### Insta
- An instagram clone built in rails. The code is available here: https://github.com/MollieS/insta
- The live website, deployed on heroku, can be viewed here: https://instamollie.herokuapp.com/

##### Chitter
- A twitter clone built with ruby and sinatra: https://github.com/MollieS/chitter-challenge
- Also deployed on heroku: https://chitterchatterchitchat.herokuapp.com/

##### Errand Runner
- A project to connect people who live/work near each other and help each other with tasks, built with a rails backend and an Ionic frontend.

##### To Do
- A simple to do list written in js with an angular framework: https://github.com/MollieS/todo_challenge


## Education

#### Makers Academy, April 2015 to July 2015
- Makers is a high intensity developer bootcamp.  Here I learnt not only how to write code, mainly ruby and javascript, but also the importance of TDD, the benefits of Agile and pair programming as well as how to use Git effectively.
- At Makers the focus is always on best practices, including Software Craftsmanship, a concept that really appeals to me and inspired me to always try to write the highest quality code I can.

#### School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London - 2009 to 2012

- BA Politics and the Study of Religion
- 2.1
